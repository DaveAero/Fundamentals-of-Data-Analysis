# Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis

This is a collection of work as part of the Fundamentals of Data Analysis module.
By: David Burke

The exercises are containined in the practicals folder. These are in a Jupter Notebook format. All required modules for each notebook are loaded at the top.

My notebook on the normal distribution is contained in the root folder. Again this requires a Jupter Notebook using Python to run.

There is no additonal data required to use this notebook, however an internet connection is required as a number of notebooks load data from web hosted CSV files.
